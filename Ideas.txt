Authentication for committee members

There is going to be another bot for the communications, which will take the chat_ids and some other info to send personalized info

Allow committee heads to get the list of their subscribers through the bot rather than through Google sheets may be useful for gem handling either way

Template:
- Have one function which gets its interactions from the redis database
- To create a flow when a given command its given the answers are reached through another instance of the redis database
- Attribute that keeps track of where you are in a given flow structure

Events:
- Add possibility to delete events

Check error when not fulfilling some flow of the access handler or event handler (not possibility of continuing interaction)

extra info: SPIS, medical centre, different admin comms,
