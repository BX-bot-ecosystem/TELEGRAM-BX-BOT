Authentication for committee members

There is going to be another bot for the communications, which will take the chat_ids and some other info to send personalized info

Allow committee heads to get the list of their subscribers through the bot rather than through Google sheets may be useful for gem handling either way

Subscriptions:
- Store the subscribers in a json file, use as key the chat id and have as value another dictionary with more information
- Allow committees to check their number of members through another or the initial bot
- Allow committees to send communications through another bot to their subscribers
- Having multiple users simultaneously update the json files will make it so that some of the registries aren't added

Committees management:
- Handling subscribers that didn't interact with the parrot bot
- Communication between bots so that one can make another one send a message
- Separating Committees Bot from Parrot Bot
